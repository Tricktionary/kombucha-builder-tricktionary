# Fullscript - Kombucha Builder

Kombucha Builder is an API for creating and managing kombucha recipes.

## Setup
This app uses Rails 5.2 and Ruby 2.6.3.

However, if you don't have Ruby 2.5 installed, please feel free to change the `.ruby-version` to whatever ruby version you have installed on your computer.

Run `bin/setup` to get all the migrations and seed files set up and going.

In this app there are tests for both rspec and minitest. Please choose whichever testing framework you are most comfortable with!


## Tips
We don't expect everyone will finish all the features below but please try to complete as many as you can. (In our minds a senior dev should be able to complete all 4 features and an intermediate should be able to do about 3.) Even though this is a test example, this should reflect your best production-like code. Please have fun and show us what you can do! 😀


## Feature request #1 - Better filtering ✅

As a user of the API I would like to filter kombucha teas by various attributes. Currently `get /api/kombuchas` returns all of the kombucha teas available but I would like to filter this list.

## Requirements
Design some way that you can filter kombucha ingredients by fizziness, caffeine_level and whether or not it's vegan.

Examples:
* `get /api/kombuchas, params: "fizziness" => "high"` should only return kombucha teas with 'high' fizziness.
* `get /api/kombuchas, params: "caffeine_free" => "true"` should return all kombucha teas that are caffeine free.
* `get /api/kombuchas, params: "vegan" => "true"` should return all vegan kombucha teas.

I should be able to combine these parameters into different combinations. Example: low fizzy, with caffeine but not vegan.

##### Kombucha Endpoint

get `/api/kombuchas`: Get Kombutcha with optimal filtering
- vegan: Boolean, (Optional)
- caffeine_free: Boolean, (Optional)
- fizziness: String, (Optional)

## Feature request #2 - Ratings ✅

Users of this app want a way to add a rating to different kombucha recipes through the API.

#### Requirements:
Make a Rating's model with the following rules:
  * should have a score that returns a number between 1 and 5.
  * Users can only have 1 rating per kombucha.

Add API endpoints so that users can:
 * See their rating
 * Create a rating
 * Update an existing rating
 * In each endpoint, add an attribute in the response to display the average rating of a given kombucha tea. This average rating should be based on all user ratings for that particular kombucha tea.

##### Rating Endpoints ✅

get `/api/ratings/:user_id`: returns all ratings from specified user 
 
post `/api/ratings`: creates a rating for a kombutcha drink
*params*
  - Interger: user_id
  - Interger: kombucha_id
  - Interger: rating

post `/api/update_rating`: updates a rating if it exist
*params*
  - Interger: user_id
  - Interger: kombucha_id
  - Interger: rating

## Feature request # 3 - Kombucha Flights ✅

As a kombucha restauranteur, I want a way to surprise and delight my customers by generating a random "flight" of kombucha drinks.

#### Requirements:
Build a random flight picker for kombucha recipes with the following rules:
  * Flights should contain 4 different kombucha recipes. They are only valid with 4.
  * Each kombucha tea in the flight should have a different tea base.

* Make an endpoint to create a flight.
  * Add an optional way to select kombucha recipes greater then a given average rating.
  * Add an optional way to select a particular kombucha recipe as part of the flight.

##### Flight Endpoints

post `/api/flights`: create a flight of 4 random kombutcha with option of adding a specified kombutcha drink or filter by rating
  - String: name
  - Integer: kombucha_id, (Optional)
  - Integer: rating, (Optional)

## Feature request 4 - Advanced Filtering

Build out your filtering object with some more advanced features.

#### Requirements
* Included Ingredients: return kombucha teas that contain the ingredients passed to it. Example: find all kombucha's that have coffee in them.
* Not Included Ingredients: return kombucha teas that *do not* contain the ingredients passed to the endpoint. Example: I don't want recipes that contain coffee
* Popular recipes: return kombucha teas that are in 'x' percent or greater of Kombucha flights.
